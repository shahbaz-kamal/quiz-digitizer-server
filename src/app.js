    //     **Specific Instructions & Considerations:**

    //     1.  **Handwritten Text:** Explicitly ignore any handwritten text, markings, or calculations. Focus solely on printed content.
    //     2.  **Question Types:**
    //         * **"MCQ" (Multiple Choice Question):** Has a question, specific options (A, B, C, D, or 1, 2, 3, 4).
    //         * **"SAQ" (Short Answer Question):** Requires a brief textual answer.
    //         * **"Activity" (Activity/Instruction):** Describes a task or experiment, often with steps, without a specific answer format, or asks for observation/explanation. Treat "Activity 1", "Activity 2", etc., as primary question blocks. Their introductory text (e.g., "ACTIVITY 1 (8 marks) Materials given: ... Instructions: ...") should be the 'main_question_text' or part of the first 'question_text' in the 'parts' array.
    //         * **"Table_Interp" (Table/Data Interpretation):** Involves extracting data from a table or interpreting data from a graph/chart.
    //         * **"Drawing_Labeling" (Drawing/Labeling):** Asks the user to draw something or label parts of a diagram.
    //         * **"Problem_Solving" (Problem Solving):** Typically involves calculations or logical deduction, common in Math papers.
    //         * **"Other":** For anything not fitting the above.
    //       3.  **Options Generation:**
    //           * If question type is "MCQ" AND options are provided in the OCR text: Extract the string content only (remove numbering/lettering like "1)", "A)").
    //           * If question type is "MCQ" AND NO options are provided in the OCR text: Generate 4 plausible options, where one is the correct answer and three are incorrect distractor options. Ensure options are simple strings (no numbering/lettering).
    //           * If question type is "Problem_Solving" AND NO options are provided in the OCR text: Calculate the answer, then generate 4 plausible options (1 correct, 3 incorrect distractors) that are related to the question's context. Ensure options are simple strings (no numbering/lettering).
    //           * For "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", "Other" types: This array MUST be empty [].
    //           * The options array MUST NOT be empty unless the question type is "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", or "Other".
    //       4.  **Correct Answer Determination:**
    //           * If a clear correct answer is explicitly present on the page (e.g., a circled option, an explicit answer in a table, or solved working visibly shown on the page for a mathematical problem), extract that answer.
    //           * For question types "MCQ" or "Problem_Solving" (where options are extracted or generated): This MUST be the exact string of the correct option found within the 'options' array.
    //           * For "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", "Other" types: If an explicit textual solution is provided on the page, extract that text into 'correct_answer'. If no explicit solution is given on the page, set 'correct_answer: "N/A"'. Do not guess for these types.
    //     5.  **Diagrams and Tables:**
    //         * For any visual elements (diagrams, graphs, charts, images) that are part of a question's context or a standalone visual on the page, provide a "diagram_description" and an array of "diagram_bounding_boxes".
    //         * "diagram_bounding_boxes" : This array MUST contain **EXACTLY ONE** object representing the **overall bounding box** for the *entire* main diagram or visual. The box should encompass the full diagram and **include a safe amount of whitespace around it**, especially vertically (e.g., extend 20-30 pixels or 5% of its height above and below its detected visual boundary) to ensure no parts are cut off. Horizontally, it can extend to the page edges if needed. For tables, provide the single overall bounding box for the entire table, with similar padding. If there are **multiple distinct main diagrams** on the page, create a separate entry in the "diagram_info" array for *each* of them, and each entry will have its own single, overall bounding box. If no diagram or table is present, return an empty array []. Example: [{"x_min": 100, "y_min": 200, "x_max": 700, "y_max": 800}]
    //         * If a visual is a table that provides data for questions, set "is_table: true".
    //         * If a table is used *as options* within an MCQ (e.g., a classification question where options are presented in rows/columns), treat these rows/columns as options in the "options" array, and do NOT include them in "diagram_info" (unless the table itself is also a primary diagram for the question, then include it but note it's also acting as options).
    //     6.  **Sub-Question Grouping:**
    //         * If a question has a main descriptive text/diagram (e.g., "The diagram below shows...", "The following table shows...") followed by sub-questions (a), (b), (c) that refer to that main text/diagram (e.g., Q8, Q9, Q10 in "P6 done ACS_Primary 2 3.02.04 AM.pdf"), then:
    //             * Create *one* question object for the main question block.
    //             * Populate "main_question_text" with the common description.
    //             * Place each sub-question (a), (b), (c) as separate objects within the "parts" array, each with its "part_id", "type", ""question_text, "options" (if MCQ), and "correct_answer".
    //             * "diagram_info" should be at the main question object level if it applies to all parts.
    //         * If questions are distinct and sequentially numbered (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) with no shared stem, create separate question objects for each, and their "parts" array will contain a single entry with '"part_id": "main"'.
    //     7.  **Individual Instructions:** If a text block provides instructions for a *set* of questions (e.g., "Questions 1 to 5 carry 2 marks each."), capture this text in the "individual_instructions" property of the *first question object* it applies to.

    //     **Provided Text (OCR Output for page ${pageNum}):**
    //     ${text}

    //     **Image Context:**
    //     [The image of the page itself will be provided alongside this text via the multimodal API input. Gemini will use its visual understanding in conjunction with the OCR text.]

    //       **Specific Instructions & Considerations:**

    //       1.  **Handwritten Text:** Explicitly ignore any handwritten text, markings, or calculations. Focus solely on printed content.
    //       2.  **Question Types:**
    //           * "MCQ" (Multiple Choice Question): Has a question, specific options (A, B, C, D, or 1, 2, 3, 4).
    //           * "SAQ" (Short Answer Question): Requires a brief textual answer.
    //           * "Activity" (Activity/Instruction): Describes a task or experiment, often with steps, without a specific answer format, or asks for observation/explanation. Treat "Activity 1", "Activity 2", etc., as primary question blocks. Their introductory text (e.g., "ACTIVITY 1 (8 marks) Materials given: ... Instructions: ...") should be the 'main_question_text' or part of the first 'question_text' in the 'parts' array.
    //           * "Table_Interp" (Table/Data Interpretation): Involves extracting data from a table or interpreting data from a graph/chart.
    //           * "Drawing_Labeling" (Drawing/Labeling): Asks the user to draw something or label parts of a diagram.
    //           * "Problem_Solving" (Problem Solving): Typically involves calculations or logical deduction, common in Math papers.
    //           * "Other": For anything not fitting the above.
    //       3.  **Options Generation:**
    //           * If question type is "MCQ" AND options are provided in the OCR text: Extract the string content only (remove numbering/lettering like "1)", "A)").
    //           * If question type is "MCQ" AND NO options are provided in the OCR text: Generate 4 plausible options, where one is the correct answer and three are incorrect distractor options. Ensure options are simple strings (no numbering/lettering).
    //           * If question type is "Problem_Solving" AND NO options are provided in the OCR text: Calculate the answer, then generate 4 plausible options (1 correct, 3 incorrect distractors) that are related to the question's context. Ensure options are simple strings (no numbering/lettering).
    //           * For "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", "Other" types: This array MUST be empty [].
    //           * The options array MUST NOT be empty unless the question type is "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", or "Other".
    //       4.  **Correct Answer Determination:**
    //           * If a clear correct answer is explicitly present on the page (e.g., a circled option, an explicit answer in a table, or solved working visibly shown on the page for a mathematical problem), extract that answer.
    //           * For question types "MCQ" or "Problem_Solving" (where options are extracted or generated): This MUST be the exact string of the correct option found within the 'options' array.
    //           * For "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", "Other" types: If an explicit textual solution is provided on the page, extract that text into 'correct_answer'. If no explicit solution is given on the page, set 'correct_answer: "N/A"'. Do not guess for these types.
    //       5.  **Diagrams and Tables:**
    //           * For any visual elements (diagrams, graphs, charts, images) that are part of a question's context or a standalone visual on the page, provide a "diagram_description" and an array of "diagram_bounding_boxes".
    //           * "diagram_bounding_boxes" MUST contain precise pixel coordinates for *each significant visual element* identified as part of a diagram or standalone image. If multiple distinct visual elements are part of one diagram (e.g., an image and its associated text labels that are separated), provide a bounding box for *each* element. The format must be an array of objects: '[{"x_min": number, "y_min": number, "x_max": number, "y_max": number}, {"x_min": ..., "y_min": ..., "x_max": ..., "y_max": ...}]'. If no diagram is present, this array should be empty [].
    //           * If a visual is a table that provides data for questions, it MUST have "is_table: true" and its "diagram_bounding_boxes".
    //           * If a table is used *as options* within an MCQ (e.g., a classification question where options are presented in rows/columns), treat these rows/columns as options in the "options" array, and do NOT include them in "diagram_info" (unless the table itself is also a primary diagram for the question, then include it but note it's also acting as options).
    //       6.  **Sub-Question Grouping:**
    //           * If a question has a main descriptive text/diagram (e.g., "The diagram below shows...", "The following table shows...") followed by sub-questions (a), (b), (c) that refer to that main text/diagram (e.g., Q8, Q9, Q10 in "P6 done ACS_Primary 2 3.02.04 AM.pdf"), then:
    //               * Create *one* question object for the main question block.
    //               * Populate "main_question_text" with the common description.
    //               * Place each sub-question (a), (b), (c) as separate objects within the "parts" array, each with its "part_id", "type", "question_text", "options" (if MCQ), and "correct_answer".
    //               * "diagram_info" should be at the main question object level if it applies to all parts.
    //           * If questions are distinct and sequentially numbered (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) with no shared stem, create separate question objects for each, and their "parts" array will contain a single entry with '"part_id": "main"'.
    //       7.  **Individual Instructions:** If a text block provides instructions for a *set* of questions (e.g., "Questions 1 to 5 carry 2 marks each."), capture this text in the "individual_instructions" property of the *first question object* it applies to.

    //       **Provided Text (OCR Output for page ${pageNum}):**

    //       3.  **Options Generation:**
    //           * If a question's 'type' is "MCQ" AND options are provided in the OCR text (e.g., '1) Digestion is complete', 'A. Some option'), **extract only the string content**, removing any leading numbers or letters (e.g., 'Digestion is complete', 'Some option'). Populate these into the 'options' array.
    //           * If a question's 'type' is "MCQ" AND **NO options are provided** in the OCR text for that question: You **MUST generate 4 plausible options**.

It should include visible labels and ensure a generous whitespace padding (e.g., at least 5% of diagram height/width or a minimum of 20-30 pixels) around the visual content, especially vertically, to prevent cropping issues. Horizontally, it can extend to the page edges if needed. For tables, provide the single overall bounding box for the entire table with similar padding. If there are **multiple distinct main diagrams** on the page, create a separate entry in the "diagram_info" array for *each* of them, and each entry will have its own single, overall bounding box.

          **Specific Instructions & Considerations:**
    
          1.  **Handwritten Text:** Explicitly ignore any handwritten text, markings, or calculations. Focus solely on printed content. Also keep this in mind while giving bounding boxes for questions
          2.  **Question Types:**
              * **"MCQ" (Multiple Choice Question):** Has a question, specific options (A, B, C, D, or 1, 2, 3, 4).
              * **"SAQ" (Short Answer Question):** Requires a brief textual answer.
              * **"Activity" (Activity/Instruction):** Describes a task or experiment, often with steps, without a specific answer format, or asks for observation/explanation. Treat "Activity 1", "Activity 2", etc., as primary question blocks. Their introductory text (e.g., "ACTIVITY 1 (8 marks) Materials given: ... Instructions: ...") should be the 'main_question_text' or part of the first 'question_text' in the 'parts' array. 
              * **"Table_Interp" (Table/Data Interpretation):** Involves extracting data from a table or interpreting data from a graph/chart.
              * **"Drawing_Labeling" (Drawing/Labeling):** Asks the user to draw something or label parts of a diagram.
              * **"Problem_Solving" (Problem Solving):** Typically involves calculations or logical deduction, common in Math papers.
              * **"Other":** For anything not fitting the above.
            3.  **Options Generation:**
                * If question type is "MCQ" AND options are provided in the OCR text: Extract the string content only (remove numbering/lettering like "1)", "A)").
                * If question type is "MCQ" AND NO options are provided in the OCR text: Generate 4 plausible options, where one is the correct answer and three are incorrect distractor options. Ensure options are simple strings (no numbering/lettering).
                * If question type is "Problem_Solving" AND NO options are provided in the OCR text: Calculate the answer, then generate 4 plausible options (1 correct, 3 incorrect distractors) that are related to the question's context. Ensure options are simple strings (no numbering/lettering).
                * For "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", "Other" types: This array MUST be empty [].
                * The options array MUST NOT be empty unless the question type is "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", or "Other".
            4.  **Correct Answer Determination:**
                * If a clear correct answer is explicitly present on the page (e.g., a circled option, an explicit answer in a table, or solved working visibly shown on the page for a mathematical problem), extract that answer.But while giving bounding box for questions don't include the answer or any other handwritten text.
                * For question types "MCQ" or "Problem_Solving" (where options are extracted or generated): This MUST be the exact string of the correct option found within the 'options' array.
                * For "SAQ", "Activity", "Table_Interp", "Drawing_Labeling", "Other" types: If an explicit textual solution is provided on the page, extract that text into 'correct_answer'. If no explicit solution is given on the page, set 'correct_answer: "N/A"'. Do not guess for these types. You should only scan handwritten text for options generation and for correct answer determination. But while giving bounding box for questions don't include the answer or any other handwritten text.
          5.  **Diagrams and Tables:**
              * For any visual elements (diagrams, graphs, charts, images) that are part of a question's context or , provide a "diagram_description" and an array of "diagram_bounding_boxes".
              * "diagram_bounding_boxes" : This array MUST contain **EXACTLY ONE** object representing the **overall bounding box** for the *entire* main diagram or visual for a spesific question. The box should encompass the full diagram by ensuring no parts are cut off.  For tables, provide the single overall bounding box for the entire table,. If there are **multiple distinct main diagrams** on the page, create a separate entry in the "diagram_info" array for *each* of them, and each entry will have its own single, overall bounding box. If no diagram or table is present, return an empty array []. Example: [{"x_min": 100, "y_min": 200, "x_max": 700, "y_max": 800}]
              * If a visual is a table that provides data for questions, set "is_table: true".
              * If a table is used *as options* within an MCQ (e.g., a classification question where options are presented in rows/columns), treat these rows/columns as options in the "options" array, and do NOT include them in "diagram_info" (unless the table itself is also a primary diagram for the question, then include it but note it's also acting as options).
          6.  **Sub-Question Grouping:**
              * If a question has a main descriptive text/diagram (e.g., "The diagram below shows...", "The following table shows...") followed by sub-questions (a), (b), (c) that refer to that main text/diagram , then:
                  * Create *one* question object for the main question block.
                  * Populate "main_question_text" with the common description.
                  * Place each sub-question (a), (b), (c) as separate objects within the "parts" array, each with its "part_id", "type", ""question_text, "options" (if MCQ), and "correct_answer".
                  * "diagram_info" should be at the main question object level if it applies to all parts.
              * If questions are distinct and sequentially numbered (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) with no shared stem, create separate question objects for each, and their "parts" array will contain question_text as null cause question text were already provided in "main_question_text".
          7.  **Individual Instructions:** If a text block provides instructions for a *set* of questions (e.g., "Questions 1 to 5 carry 2 marks each."), capture this text in the "individual_instructions" property of the *first question object* it applies to.
    
          **Provided Text (OCR Output for page ${pageNum}):**
          ${text}
    
          **Image Context:**
